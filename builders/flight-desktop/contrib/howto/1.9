## Verifying and Installing a Desktop

Before a desktop can be used, it must be installed and verified. Please contact your system administrator
if the `verify` command fails. The `prepare` command requires requires root privileges to install the
required packages.

~~~
$ flight desktop verify gnome
Verifying desktop type gnome:

   > OK Flight Desktop prerequisites
   > NO Prerequisite: polkit policies
   > OK Package group: X Window System
   > NO Package group: Fonts
   > OK Package group: GNOME
   > NO Package: evince
   > NO Package: firefox

Desktop type gnome has missing prerequisites:

 * Configuration: polkit policies
 * Package group: X Window System
 * Package group: Fonts
 * Package group: GNOME
 * Package: evince
 * Package: firefox

Before this desktop type can be used, it must be prepared by your
cluster administrator using the 'prepare' command, i.e.:

  flight desktop prepare gnome
~~~

Once the required packages are installed, the desktop will verify successfully:

~~~
$ flight desktop verify terminal
Verifying desktop type terminal:

   > OK Flight Desktop prerequisites
   > OK Package: xorg-x11-server-utils
   > OK Package: xterm

Desktop type terminal has been verified.
~~~

## Starting a Session

A new session can be created with the `start` command:

~~~
$ flight desktop start terminal
Starting a 'terminal' desktop session:

   > OK Starting session

A 'terminal' desktop session has been started.

== Session details ==

  Identity: 7d6d8b87-e32c-4f16-8362-9e15f90e69e2
      Type: terminal
   Host IP: 10.10.0.1
  Hostname: master
      Port: 5923
   Display: :1
  Password: XXXXXXXX

This desktop session is not directly accessible from outside of your
cluster as it is running on a machine that only provides internal
cluster access.  In order to access your desktop session you will need
to perform port forwarding using 'ssh'.

Refer to 'flight desktop show 7d6d8b87' for more details.

If prompted, you should supply the following password: XXXXXXX
~~~

The session is now ready to be accessed with your favourite vnc client.

### Environment options

By default, when starting a session, the session environment is reset, and
therefore does not keep environment variables from the machine it is started
from. To override this feature, and carry over environment variables from the
machine, you can include the following argument at the command line:

~~~
flight desktop start gnome --no-override-env
~~~

This is particularly important when starting interactive desktop sessions from
Flight Job, as the latter tool sets various environment variables for SLURM and
other job related packages.

The application also supports the inverse functionality. By using the following argument:

~~~
flight desktop start gnome --override-env
~~~

The environment is forcefully blanked, regardless of the inclusion of `--no-override-env` or the value given in `config.yml`.

### Starting Applications

When you start a session you can provide a "post initializtion" script to run
once your session has started.  You could use this script to start some default
applications inside of your session.

The script is specified with the `--script` flag and will be ran inside of a
suitable terminal emulator for your session type.  E.g., if you are running a
Gnome session, your script will be ran inside of a Gnome Terminal.

For example, in order to launch `R` running inside of a terminal emulator, you
could create the file `/tmp/my-script.sh` containing the following:

~~~
#!/bin/bash
module load apps/R/3.4.2
R
~~~

It could then be used to launch `R` inside of your desktop session, by running.

~~~
flight desktop start gnome --script /tmp/my-script.sh
~~~

Some desktop types also support an `--app` flag which can be given multiple
times to launch graphical applications.  This may be more convenient than
writing the equivalent script.

~~~
# Launch multiple applications within your session
flight desktop start gnome \
  --app firefox \
  --app "/path/to/launch/script arg1 arg2"
~~~

The session can be configured to automatically exit when the post
initializtion script exits.  To do so pass the flag `--kill-on-script-exit`.
This flag only makes sense when a `--script` is specified.

## List Running Sessions

The running sessions are returned by the `list` command:

~~~
$ flight desktop list
~~~

| Identity | Type  | Host name | IP address | Display   | Password | State  |
|----------|-------|-----------|------------|-----------|----------|--------|
| 7d6d8b87 | gnome | master    | 10.10.0.1  | :1 (5923) | XXXXXXXX | Active |
| ...      | ...   | ...       | ...        | ...       | ...      | ...    |

## Terminate a Session

A session is terminated using the `kill` command. It takes either the shortened or
full ID.

~~~
$ flight desktop kill 7d6d8b87
Killing desktop session 7d6d8b87-e32c-4f16-8362-9e15f90e69e2:

   > OK Terminating session

Desktop session '7d6d8b87-e32c-4f16-8362-9e15f90e69e2' has been terminated.
