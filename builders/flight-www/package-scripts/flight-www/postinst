SSL certificates are currently configured to be checked for renewal daily.
This may be too frequent and there is a small chance that this could cause
issues.  You should consider changing this to a weekly check.  To do so:

1. Delete the file /opt/flight/etc/cron/daily/cert-renewal
2. Edit the flight cert configuration file /opt/flight/etc/cert.yaml
   and ensure the `cron_path` is set to use the weekly directory.
3. Run /opt/flight/bin/flight www cron-renewal

The domain can be changed by running:
  flight www cert-gen --domain DOMAIN

A LetsEncrypt certificate can be generated by running:
  flight www cert-gen --cert-type lets-encrypt --domain DOMAIN --email EMAIL

See 'flight www --help' and 'flight www cert-gen --help' for more details.
