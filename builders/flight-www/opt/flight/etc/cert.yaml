# Program Configurations
# Configures various components of the CLI
# ==============================================================================
program_name: flight www
# program_application: 'Flight WWW'
# program_description: 'Manage the HTTPs server and SSL certificates'

# ==============================================================================
# Certificate Type
# Specify whether a "lets_encrypt" or "self_signed" certificate should be used.
#
# It is recommended that snake_case is used for the values, but other cases are
# accepted. This includes:
# snake_case, kebab-case, CamalCase, UPPER_SNAKE (+ others)
# ==============================================================================
# cert_type: 'lets_encrypt'

# ==============================================================================
# Email
# Stores the email address that all newly generated certificates will be
# associated with.
#
# The email is required for lets-encrypt certificates but optional for
# self-signed.
# ==============================================================================
# email:

# ==============================================================================
# Domain
# Stores the domain all newly generated certificates will be associated with.
# ==============================================================================
# domain:

# ==============================================================================
# Self Signed Directory
# Define the directory to where self signed certificates will be stored. This
# path should not be used by the external web service.
#
# Relative paths are expanded from flight_ROOT (or the install directory, if
# flight_ROOT is unset).
# ==============================================================================
# selfsigned_dir: etc/www/self-signed

# ==============================================================================
# SSL Fullchain Certificate and Private Key
# Define the path to the target SSL fullchain  and private key files. The
# application will symlink the relevant files to these locations. The external
# web service should use these symlink files.
#
# Relative paths are expanded from flight_ROOT (or the install directory, if
# flight_ROOT is unset).
# ==============================================================================
# ssl_fullchain: etc/www/ssl/fullchain.pem
# ssl_privkey: etc/www/ssl/key.pem

# ==============================================================================
# Lets Encrypt Live Directory
# Define where LetsEncrypt stores its live certificates.
#
# Relative paths are expanded from flight_ROOT (or the install directory, if
# flight_ROOT is unset).
# ==============================================================================
# letsencrypt_live_dir: etc/letsencrypt/live

# ==============================================================================
# Certbot "Binary" and Flags
# Define the path to the certbot bin file.
#
# The "certbot plugin flags" are any additional options to certbot's certonly
# command. The --domain DOMAIN, --email EMAIL, --n, --agree-tos flags will be
# automatically set by the application. However additional flags maybe required
# depending on your system's configuration.
# ==============================================================================
certbot_bin: /opt/flight/opt/certbot/bin/certbot
certbot_plugin_flags: --nginx --nginx-ctl /opt/flight/opt/www/embedded/sbin/nginx --nginx-server-root /opt/flight/etc/www --config-dir /opt/flight/etc/letsencrypt --logs-dir /opt/flight/var/log/letsencrypt --work-dir /opt/flight/var/lib/letsencrypt

# ==============================================================================
# Cron Path and Script
# Define the path to and the content of the auto-renewal cron script.  The
# script is expected to run 'bin/cert cert-gen' without any arguments.
#
# However due to the idiosyncrasies of ruby's versioning, the content of the
# script will be platform/distribution specific. As such no default has been
# given for 'cron_scirpt'. It will need to be manually set in the config before
# auto renewals are possible.
#
# Relative paths for `cron_path` are expanded from flight_ROOT (or the install
# directory, if flight_ROOT is unset).
# ==============================================================================
# cron_path: etc/cron/weekly/cert-renewal
cron_script: "#!/bin/bash\n/opt/flight/bin/flight www cert-gen\n"

# ==============================================================================
# HTTPS Enabled Paths
# Specify a list of files required by the HTTPs which are normally disabled.
# The following assumptions must be valid for this application to function:
# * All the paths form a "path pair" of enabled and disabled files,
# * All paths must be absolute,
# * The HTTPs server is only considered running if all the enabled files exist,
# * This config provides a list of "enable paths",
# * A "disable path" matches its corresponding "enable path" with an
#   additional '.disabled' file extension, and
# * All the disabled files exist.
#
# The `enable-https` will generate symlinks from the enable paths to their
# corresponding disabled path. The `disable-https` method will remove all these
# symlinks.
#
# This service can not generate the content of the disabled files. They must
# exist before using this application. Failure to ensure the disabled files
# exist risks the generation of dangling symlinks.
#
# Relative paths are expanded from flight_ROOT (or the install directory, if
# flight_ROOT is unset).
# ==============================================================================
https_enable_paths:
  - /opt/flight/etc/www/http.d/https.conf
  - /opt/flight/etc/www/server-http.d/redirect-http-to-https.conf

# ==============================================================================
# Service Status Command
# Define the system command which will check if the external web service is
# running. It must exit 0 if and only if the service is running.
#
# This config must be set in order for LetsEncrypt to operate correctly.
# ==============================================================================
status_command: /opt/flight/bin/flight service status www | grep active

# ==============================================================================
# Service Restart Command
# Define the system command which will restart the external web service. It
# must exit 0 if and only if the service restarted correctly.
#
# This config must be set for most operations to function correctly.
# ==============================================================================
restart_command: /opt/flight/bin/flight service restart www | grep 'service has been restarted'

# ==============================================================================
# Start Service Command
# An optional command to include in the error message on how to start the web
# server. It is not executed by the tool.
# ==============================================================================
start_command_prompt: /opt/flight/bin/flight service start www

# ==============================================================================
# Log Path
# The file the logger will write to. It will write to standard error if
# omitted.
#
# Relative paths are expanded from flight_ROOT (or the install directory, if
# flight_ROOT is unset).
# ==============================================================================
# log_path: var/log/cert.log

# ==============================================================================
# Log level
# Set at which severity the application will log
# Valid levels: 'disabled', 'fatal', 'error', 'warn', 'info', 'debug'
# ==============================================================================
# log_level: error
