# Program Configurations
# Configures various components of the CLI
# ==============================================================================
program_name: flight www
# program_application: 'Flight WWW'
# program_description: 'Manage the HTTPS server and SSL certificates'

# ==============================================================================
# Certificate Type
# Specify whether a "lets_encrypt" or "self_signed" certificate should be used.
# ==============================================================================
# cert_type: 'lets_encrypt'

# ==============================================================================
# Email
# Stores the email address that all newly generated certificates will be
# associated with.
#
# The email is required for lets-encrypt certificates but optional for
# self-signed.
# ==============================================================================
# email:

# ==============================================================================
# Domain
# Stores the domain all newly generated certificates will be associated with.
# ==============================================================================
# domain:

# ==============================================================================
# Self Signed Directory
# Define the directory to where self signed certificates will be stored.  The
# web service should not be configured to load these file directly, see
# `ssl_fullchain` and `ssl_privkey` for more information.
#
# Relative paths are expanded according to the "Relative path expansion" rules
# described below.
# ==============================================================================
# selfsigned_dir: etc/www/self-signed

# ==============================================================================
# SSL Fullchain Certificate and Private Key
# Define the path to the target SSL fullchain  and private key files. The
# application will symlink the relevant files to these locations. The web
# service should be configured to load these symlinks when they exist.
#
# Relative paths are expanded according to the "Relative path expansion" rules
# described below.
# ==============================================================================
# ssl_fullchain: etc/www/ssl/fullchain.pem
# ssl_privkey: etc/www/ssl/key.pem

# ==============================================================================
# Lets Encrypt Live Directory
# Define where LetsEncrypt stores its live certificates.
#
# Relative paths are expanded according to the "Relative path expansion" rules
# described below.
# ==============================================================================
# letsencrypt_live_dir: etc/letsencrypt/live

# ==============================================================================
# Certbot "Binary" and Flags
# Define the path to the certbot bin file.
#
# The "certbot plugin flags" are any additional options to certbot's certonly
# command. The --domain DOMAIN, --email EMAIL, --n, --agree-tos flags will be
# automatically set by the application. However additional flags maybe required
# depending on your system's configuration.
# ==============================================================================
certbot_bin: /opt/flight/opt/certbot/bin/certbot
certbot_plugin_flags: --nginx --nginx-ctl /opt/flight/opt/www/embedded/sbin/nginx --nginx-server-root /opt/flight/etc/www --config-dir /opt/flight/etc/letsencrypt --logs-dir /opt/flight/var/log/letsencrypt --work-dir /opt/flight/var/lib/letsencrypt

# ==============================================================================
# Cron Path and Script
# Define the path to and the content of the auto-renewal cron script.  The
# script is expected to run 'flight www cert-gen' without any arguments.  You
# will likely need to use a full path to 'flight'.
#
# 'cron_path' needs to be a path that the cron daemon will process.  It should
# be ran weekly.
#
# Relative paths are expanded according to the "Relative path expansion" rules
# described below.
# ==============================================================================
# cron_path: etc/cron/weekly/cert-renewal
cron_script: "#!/bin/bash\n/opt/flight/bin/flight www cert-gen\n"

# ==============================================================================
# HTTPS Enabled Paths
# Specify a list of symlinks to create and remove when HTTPS is enabled and
# disabled.  The following must be valid:
#
# * The listed paths are managed by Flight Cert.
# * For each listed file there is a corresponding '.disabled' file.  The
#   '.disabled' file is named as per the listed file, but with an additional
#   '.disabled' path.
# * Creating a symlink from each listed file to its '.disabled' file (and
#   restarting the web server) is sufficient to enable HTTPS.
# * Removing the symlinks from each listed file to its '.disabled' file (and
#   restarting the web server) is sufficient to disable HTTPS.
#
# Flight Cert does not generate the content of the disabled files. They must
# exist before using this application. Failure to ensure the disabled files
# exist risks the generation of dangling symlinks.
#
# Relative paths are expanded according to the "Relative path expansion" rules
# described below.
# ==============================================================================
https_enable_paths:
  - /opt/flight/etc/www/http.d/https.conf
  - /opt/flight/etc/www/server-http.d/redirect-http-to-https.conf

# ==============================================================================
# Service Status Command
# Define the system command which will check if the external web service is
# running. It must exit 0 if and only if the service is running.
#
# This config must be set in order for LetsEncrypt to operate correctly.
# ==============================================================================
status_command: /opt/flight/bin/flight service status www | grep active

# ==============================================================================
# Service Restart Command
# Define the system command which will restart the external web service. It
# must exit 0 if and only if the service restarted correctly.
#
# This config must be set for most operations to function correctly.
# ==============================================================================
restart_command: /opt/flight/bin/flight service restart www | grep 'service has been restarted'

# ==============================================================================
# Start Service Command
# An optional command to include in the error message on how to start the web
# server. It is not executed by the tool.
# ==============================================================================
start_command_prompt: /opt/flight/bin/flight service start www

# ==============================================================================
# Log Path
# The file the logger will write to. It will write to standard error if
# omitted.
#
# Relative paths are expanded according to the "Relative path expansion" rules
# described below.
# ==============================================================================
# log_path: var/log/cert.log

# ==============================================================================
# Log level
# Set at which severity the application will log
# Valid levels: 'disabled', 'fatal', 'error', 'warn', 'info', 'debug'
# ==============================================================================
# log_level: error

# ==============================================================================
# Relative path expansion rules
#
# Relative paths, where supported, are expanded in one of two ways:
#
# 1. If Flight Cert was installed from the OpenFlight package repos, they will
#    be expanded from the value of the `flight_ROOT` environment
#    variable.
# 2. Otherwise they will be expanded from the Flight Cert installation
#    directory.
