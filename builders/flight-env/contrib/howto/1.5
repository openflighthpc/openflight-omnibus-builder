## Install, List and Remove an Environment

An environment needs to be installed before it can be used. This is done using the
`create` command. You will need log out and in again before activating the environment.

~~~
$ flight env create gridware
Creating environment gridware@default
   > OK Verifying prerequisites
   > OK Fetching prerequisite (tcl) 
   > OK Extracting prerequisite (tcl) 
   > OK Building prerequisite (tcl)
   > OK Installing prerequisite (tcl) 
   > OK Fetching prerequisite (modules) 
   > OK Extracting prerequisite (modules) 
   > OK Building prerequisite (modules) 
   > OK Installing prerequisite (modules) 
   > OK Fetching prerequisite (gridware) 
   > OK Extracting prerequisite (gridware) 
   > OK Installing prerequisite (gridware) 
   > OK Configuring repo: main 
   > OK Creating environment (gridware@default) 
Environment gridware@default has been created
~~~

The environments which have been installed can be retrieved with the `list` command:

~~~
$ flight env list
~~~

| Name             | Scope |
|------------------|-------|
| gridware@default | user  |

The environment can be removed with the `purge` command:

~~~
$ flight env purge gridware@default
Purge environment gridware@default? yes
Purging environment gridware@default
   > OK Deleting environment tree (gridware@default) 
Environment gridware@default has been purge

$ flight env list
No configured environments.
~~~

## Temporarily Enable/Disable an Environment

An environment can be temporarily enabled using the `activate` command. This will enable
the environment within the current shell but will not affect the default.

~~~
$ flight env activate gridware
$ gridware --help
NAME:
  
  gridware
...
~~~
NOTE: The environment will need to be recreated if it was purged in the previous step

To retrieve the currently active environment:

~~~
$ flight env show-active
gridware@default
~~~

The environment can be disabled using the `deactivate` command:

~~~
$ flight env deactivate
$ gridware --help
-bash: gridware: command not found
~~~

## Permanently Enable an Environment

An environment can be permanently set as the login environment for the
current user with the `set-default` command:

~~~
$ flight env set-default gridware
Default environment set to: gridware@default
~~~

By executing the command as root, a system-wide default login environment
can be set using the `--global` option:

~~~
$ sudo /opt/flight/bin/flight env set-default gridware --global
Default global environment set to: gridware@default
~~~

Note that the user default login environment takes precedence over the
system-wide default.

The user and system-wide defaults can be removed with the
`--remove` option:

~~~
$ flight env set-default --remove
Default environment removed

$ flight env set-default --remove --global
Default global environment removed
~~~
