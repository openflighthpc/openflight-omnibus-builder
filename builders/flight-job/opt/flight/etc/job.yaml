# ==============================================================================
# Relative path expansion rules
#
# Relative paths, where supported, are expanded in one of two ways:
#
# 1. If Flight Job was installed from the OpenFlight package repos, they will
#    be expanded from the value of the `flight_ROOT` environment
#    variable.
# 2. Otherwise they will be expanded from the Flight Job installation
#    directory.
