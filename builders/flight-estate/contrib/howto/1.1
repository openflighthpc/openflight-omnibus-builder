## Change a Machine's Instance Type

The instance types of the machines can be modified using the `change` command.

text. For the purposes of this guide, it is assumed that `general-small` and
`general-large` are valid instance types. The exact list of types can be found
in the help text:

~~~
$ flight estate change --help
~~~

To change the instance type of a single node:

~~~
$ flight estate change node01 general-large
Change machine type for node01. If powered on it will be rebooted. Confirm to proceed [y/n]?
Powering off...
OK
Changing machine type...
OK
Powering on...
OK
~~~

Changing the instance type of a running node will trigger a reboot. This is
because the instance type can only be changed whilst offline. The `--confirm`
can be used to bypass the confirmation message

~~~
$ flight estate change node01 general-large --confirm
Powering off...
OK
Changing machine type...
OK
Powering on...
OK
~~~

Multiple nodes' instance types can be changed simultaneously with the `--group`
flag. The flag takes a comma separated list of machine names.

~~~
$ flight estate change --group node01,node02 general-small
Change machine type for group node01,node02. If powered on it will be rebooted. Confirm to proceed [y/n]?
~~~

## Add Additional Machines

Additional machines can be added to the compute estate with the `grow` command. The
request will be processed and the new machines will be available shortly.

```
$ flight estate grow 20 general-small
Your request has been received and will be processed shortly.
```

## Remove Machines

The compute estate can be reduced in size with the `shrink` command. The request
will be processed and the new machines will be available shortly.

```
$ flight estate shrink 10 general-small
Your request has been received and will be processed shortly.
```
