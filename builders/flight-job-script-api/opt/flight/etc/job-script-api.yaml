# Relative path expansion rules
#
# Relative paths, where supported, are expanded in one of two ways:
#
# 1. If Flight Job Script API was installed from the OpenFlight package repos,
#    they will be expanded from the value of the `flight_ROOT` environment
#    variable.
# 2. Otherwise they will be expanded from the Flight Job Script API
#    installation directory.
